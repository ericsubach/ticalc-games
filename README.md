# TI-83 Plus Calculator Games

All my TI-83 Plus games developed and published on [ticalc.org](www.ticalc.org) way back in 2004.

Most of these games are written in [TI-BASIC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-BASIC), similar to the [BASIC programming language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC).

The BASIC files were typed directly on my calculator using the built-in editor. I believe the editor is able to convert between plaintext and the binary (.8xp) format. As far as I know, loading these on the editor will show the original source code. However, I found a great tool called [SourceCoder 3](http://www.cemetech.net/sc/) to decompile my BASIC games. I have included the decompiled source, so they may not be completely accurate.


Maze and Tic-Tac-Toe are the only games written in TI-Assembly, which is a variant of [Zilog Z80 assembly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilog_Z80). I have included the source code for both games.
